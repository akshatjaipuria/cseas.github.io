# Introduction

Windows has a reputation in the linux community for being a nosy OS that doesn't really listen too well to an advanced user. One of these features is it's Windows Update.  

# Problem

Every once in a while when you use Windows, it throws you this message to install the really "Important Updates", or the world shall end as we know it.

I was greeted by this, to be particular, the Windows 10 October 2018 update. And I thought okay, no harm, so I click "Restart now".  

Behold! Arrives the blue screen of death.

And after the update I notice my grub boot loader is gone with Windows Boot Manager taking control of the system. \*insert evil laugh*

# Solution

Let's admit it, Windows has never really been built with a dual-boot system compatibility in mind. As a result, the update seems to have erased the grub boot loader entry from the boot sequence.

Here's how to get it back:

1. From your Windows 10, get to the BIOS startup menu by holding down the `Shift` key while you press `Restart` from the power options.

2. You'll eventually bump into this screen where you can choose `Advanced Options`.

3. In the next screen, select `UEFI Firmware Settings`

4. In the next window, select `Boot Sequence` as shown.

5. In `Boot List Option`, select the radio button for `UEFI`, and click `Add Boot Option`. Now you can browser for your `grubx64.efi` file usually located in `efi/ubuntu/` directory.
