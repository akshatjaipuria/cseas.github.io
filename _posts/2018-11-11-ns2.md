# Introduction

[NS2](http://nsnam.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/User_Information) is an open-source simulation tool that runs on Linux. It is a discreet event simulator targeted at networking research and provides substantial support for simulation of routing, multicast protocols and IP protocols, such as UDP, TCP, RTP and SRM over wired and wireless (local and satellite) networks.

# Pre-requisites

To view your network simulation traces made using ns-2, you'll need [Nam: Network Animator](https://www.isi.edu/nsnam/nam/).

Nam is a Tcl/TK based animation tool for viewing network simulation traces and real world packet traces. It supports topology layout, packet level animation, and various data inspection tools.

Install it by running the following command in your terminal:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y nam
```

# Installation

Run the following command in your terminal to install ns-2:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y ns2
```
![](/assets/images/ns2/ss1.png){: .align-center}

---

# Check your installation

You can check your installation by running a simple [Tcl](https://www.tcl.tk/about/language.html) script.

1. Create a file:
    ```sh
    gedit add.tcl
    ```
2. Paste the following code in the file:
    ```tcl
    set a 20
    set b 30
    set c [expr $a+$b]
    puts $c
    ```
3. Run in the terminal using ns-2:
    ```sh
    ns add.tcl
    ```
    ![](/assets/images/ns2/ss3.png){: .align-center}

# Running a simple simulation

1. Paste the following code in a file `simple.tcl`:
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/cseas/3639de92b03cc27ca3c480b3a0d3af90.js"></script>

2. Run the simulation from the terminal using ns-2:
    ```sh
    ns simple.tcl
    ```
3. Click on the play button to start the simulation:
    ![](/assets/images/ns2/ss4.png){: .align-center}

If you are a beginner to network simulation, you can find the explanation for the above script [here](http://nile.wpi.edu/NS/simple_ns.html).  

The **ns-allinone-2.31** package is available [here](https://github.com/cseas/vtulabs/tree/master/15CSL57_Computer_Network_Laboratory) if needed.
