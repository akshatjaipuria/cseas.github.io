Hi!

I am Abhijeet Singh, a pre-final year Computer Science & Engineering student.

I develop open source software related to AI and Web. In my spare time, I love watching squirrels and reading Dan Brown.

The top global nominee from India for [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2018](http://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/), and one of 1200 [Microsoft Student Partners](https://microsoftstudentpartners.com) across the world.

Feel free to reach out to me on my social channels.

Excelsior!
